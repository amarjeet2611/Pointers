# C++ Pointers Tutorial

This repository provides a beginner-friendly tutorial on using pointers in C++. If you're new to C++ or just want to refresh your knowledge of pointers, you've come to the right place.

## Introduction to Pointers

In C++, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are a powerful feature in C++ and are used for various purposes, including dynamic memory allocation, working with arrays, and passing parameters to functions by reference.

This tutorial will cover the basics of pointers, including how to declare and use them, pointer arithmetic, and common pitfalls to avoid.

## Declaring Pointers

```cpp
int* ptr; // Declares a pointer to an integer
double* ptr2; // Declares a pointer to a double

#Common Pointer Pitfalls
Avoid common mistakes when working with pointers, like dereferencing null pointers or using uninitialized pointers.
